Initial Water Softener Project  

* AUTHOR DEAN GREENHOUGH  07/09/2019
 * INITAL WATER SOFTENER PROJECT
 * ESP32, VL53, I2C, SPI, ePAPER DISPLAY, ESP DEEP SLEEP, NTP, WDT, WIFI MANAGER, PROWL NOTIFICATION, JSON, MQTT, AVERAGING SAMPLES, CALIBRATION, SPIFFS 
 * LESSONS LEARNED 
 * ABANDONED DUE TO POWER DEEP SLEEP CURRENT BEING 4.8uA  AND NOT SUITABLE FOR PROPOSED PROJECT.
 * THE VL53'S HAVE PROVED TROUBLESOME WITH ALTERATIONS TO THE CORE CODE TO PREVENT SYSTEM CRASH ON I2C BUS AND THE PROBLEMS ASSOSCIATED WITH MODIFYING THE CORE HAL CODE.
 * THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED USING A I2C MULTIPLIER AND WILL OVERCOME MODIFICATION OF THE CORE CODE.......MODULE PURCHASED TO BE TESTED
 * ePAPER DISPLAY REQUIRES FURTHER EXPLORATION AND PARTIAL UPDATES WILL PROVE TO BE IMPORTANT AS FULL DISPLAY UPDATE TAKES 10Secs 
 * THIS CODE IS WORKING STABLE AND JUST DEMONSTRATES A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS NOT ELEGANT BY ANY STANDARD
 * THIS WAS ABANDONED FOR A FRESH START IN THE HOPE OF CONDENSING THE CODE, USING NEWLY DISCOVERED HARDWARE TO SOLVE THE VL53 CONFLICT 
 * THE ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OTA UPDATES AND FIRMWARE UPGRADES TO uCONTROLERS IN THE FIELD AUTOMATICALY  REQUIRES A DIFFERENT APPROACH.
